## 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

Diabetes Prediction System A machine learning-based project to predict the likelihood of diabetes using health data such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and blood pressure. Built with Python and the Indian Diabetes dataset, it offers data analysis, risk prediction, and visualizations to assist in early detection and awareness.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model for diabetes. Using features like glucose level, BMI, age, etc., the model helps in early prediction of diabetes, which can assist in proactive healthcare planning.
